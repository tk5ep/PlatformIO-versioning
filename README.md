# PlatformIO-versioning  
PlatformIO versioning scripts written in Python for renaming the compiled hex file after a version number following the SME syntax:  

Two versions of versionings are available here :  
- an automatic that increments the version number at EACH compiling  
- a manual that needs the version number to be changed manually in platformIO.ini  

I hope this helps... Let me know.
